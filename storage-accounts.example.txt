# Example storage accounts file
# You can list storage account names one per line or comma-separated
# Lines starting with # are ignored
# Empty lines are ignored

storageaccount1
storageaccount2
storageaccount3

# Or use comma-separated format:
# storageaccount1,storageaccount2,storageaccount3

# Mixed format also works:
# storageaccount4, storageaccount5
# storageaccount6
